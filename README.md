# project-1b-EMG_data_for_gestures-master (with NN)
Classifier using Keras Neural Network

Same dataset as 'project-1-EMG_data_for_gestures-master'. Dataset can be found on: https://github.com/exelban/myo-armband-nn (thanks again, exelban).

This time I used a Keras Neural Network to train a model that predicts the handgestures with the data generated by the MYO armband. I aimed for a better accuracy (without significant inscrease of runtime).

## The notebook file contains the following steps:
0. importing libaries
1. loading data and prepping data
2. creating and compiling model
3. train model
4. evaluating model

## Results
Results can be found on the bottom of the Notebook file. Increase of accuracy of approximately 5% was easily achieved.
